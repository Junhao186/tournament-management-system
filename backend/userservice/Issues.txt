If user exists and you try to POST again that should give an error saying user already exists
    - Name is unique 

If user with id = 2 has been deleted, he cannot be reinserted with id = 2


What makes a user unique?
    - Id (UNIQUE)
    - Email

Test cases to check
1. What if 2 users have the same name?
2. Delete user with id = x then add that user again
3. What if 2 users have the same id?
    - Code runs
    - If same id but different email addresses, id of new user will increment
    - Error only because email is unique


User Code
- userId is autogenerated. It is not specified to a user. UserId depends on the order in which users are inserted.
- when a user is deleted, userId is not reused. Eg is user with Id = 2 is deleted, and then that user is added again, he/she will be given a new id
- infact you don't even have to specify userId in the JSON format because it is autogenerated
- All user APIs seem to be working
